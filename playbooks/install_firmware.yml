# Install Firmware Upgrade
# Need to necessarily pass the following three variables for this playbook to work:
#   install_firmware_file: "/home/python/isam_9.0.2.0_20161102-2353.pkg"
#   install_firmware_version: "9.0.2.0"
#   install_firmware_release_date: "2016-11-02"
# The above two can be deduced from the pkg file name
